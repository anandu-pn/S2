# Java Programming Tasks

## 1. Create a Class for Products
- Create a `Product` class with members:
  - `productName`: Name of the product.
  - `price`: Price of the product.
  - `code`: Product code.
- Create an object for the `Product` class.
- Write logic to find the product with the lowest price.

## 2. Matrix Operations
Write a menu-driven program to perform matrix operations:
- **Addition**
- **Multiplication**
- **Transpose**

---

## 3. Addition of Complex Numbers
Write a program to:
- Add two complex numbers.

---

## 4. Matrix Symmetry Check
Create a program to:
- Check whether a matrix is symmetric or not.

---

## 5. Array Search
- Create an array.
- Search for a particular item in the array.

---

## 6. String Manipulation
Perform various string operations:
- Convert to **lowercase**.
- Convert to **uppercase**.
- Find the **length** of the string.
- Extract a **substring**.
- Find the **index of the first occurrence** of a character in the given string.

## 7. Employee Salary Calculation
Create a Java program with a class for an employee:
- Attributes:
  - `enum`: Employee number.
  - `ename`: Employee name.
  - `salary`: Basic salary.
- Find the total salary of the employee including:
  - `DA`, `HRA`, and `Basic`.

---

## 8. Array of Employee Objects
- Create a class for employees:
  - Attributes:
    - `enum`: Employee number.
    - `ename`: Employee name.
    - `salary`: Employee salary.
- Read data for `n` employees.
- Search for an employee using the employee number (use the concept of an array of objects).

---

## 9. String Sorting Using `compareTo()`
- Write a Java program to sort strings using the `compareTo()` function.

---

## 10. Overloaded Functions for Area Calculation
- Write a program to calculate the area of different shapes using overloaded functions.

---

## 11. Employee and Teacher Classes
- Create a Java program with a class for an employee:
  - Attributes:
    - `enum`: Employee number.
    - `ename`: Employee name.
    - `salary`: Employee salary.
    - `address`: Employee address.
  - Create constructors to initialize the attributes.
- Create another class `Teacher` that inherits the properties of the `Employee` class. It should have its own attributes:
  - `department`: Teacher's department.
  - `tname`: Teacher's name.
  - `subjectCode`: Subject code.
  - Create constructors to initialize the attributes.
- Include a display method to show all data members.
- Use an array of objects to display details for `n` teachers.

---

## 12. Interface for Shapes
- Create an interface with prototypes for two functions:
  - `area()`: Calculate the area.
  - `perimeter()`: Calculate the perimeter.
- Create two classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that implement the above interface.
- Write a menu-driven program to find the area and perimeter of objects.

---

## Notes
Each task is designed to explore key Java concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, arrays, overloaded functions, and string manipulations. Follow proper coding practices and ensure your program handles edge cases effectively.
